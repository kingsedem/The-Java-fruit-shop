## Fruit Shop Cart Calculator Kata

In this kata, the challenge is to write a Fruit Shop Cart Calculator. 
Write tests code to illustrate the following requirements, 
and write the additional application code I need to make them work:

- The shop sells apples, oranges, bananas, pears, peaches and other fruit, depending on availability. 
For example the prices per kilo for the currently available fruits are:
    - Apples:  $4.00
    - Oranges: $5.50
    - Bananas: $6.00
    - Pears:   $4.50
- Update the catalog with the current market price of a fruit
- The Catalog should list the names of the currently available fruits in alphabetical order
- The Catalog should throw a FruitUnavailableException if the fruit is not currently available
- You can add items to your shopping cart, which should keep a running total.
- When you buy 5 kilos or more of any fruit, you get a 10% discount.
